                            The majority of tea estates in the area are managed by Bogawantalawa Tea Estates Ltd (BPL Teas). The prominence of the name of the company may have helped the erroneous spelling and name of the town.

The company's products include black, green, white, herbal, organic, and flavored teas. It offers its products in the form of string and tea bags, as well as in tins and wooden boxes. The company was formerly known as Bogawantalawa Plantations Limited and changed its name to Bogawantalawa Tea Estates PLC in April 2008. The company was incorporated in 1992 and is based in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Bogawantalawa Tea Estates PLC is a subsidiary of Metropolitan Resource Holdings PLC.
                            BPL Teas is the largest Sri Lankan supplier of iced tea to the USA. Since 2004, Walters Bay-BPL Teas has continuously received the best iced tea award at the World Tea Expo.

                            Our journey began in 1992 when the government of Sri Lanka decided to privatize the “Management” of the then existing 22 Regional Plantation Companies which consisted of Tea, Rubber, Coconut & Palm Oil. This paved the path for a strategic joint venture between Watawala Plantations PLC and Tata Tea Ltd. of India.<br>
